# BluetoothLE-powered-Android-App-for-ESP32

The BluetoothLE Data Transmission App is designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of data between a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device and an Android application. The application leverages the BLE protocol to establish a connection with the device, retrieve sensor data, and display it on the Android interface.

## Key Features:
1. **Bluetooth Connection:** The app establishes a Bluetooth connection with a specified BLE device using Android's Bluetooth Low Energy APIs.
2. **Data Retrieval:** It retrieves sensor data from the connected BLE device at regular intervals.
3. **Real-time Display:** The acquired data is dynamically displayed on the Android app's user interface in real-time.
4. **User Interaction:** The app provides a user-friendly interface with options such as reconnecting to the device.

### Current Issue:
The project currently faces a challenge in establishing a stable Bluetooth connection and updating the UI with the sensor data. Iâ€™m actively working to resolve this issue and seeks assistance from the community to identify and rectify any potential bugs or inefficiencies.

#### How You Can Contribute:
- Review the provided code for any logical or syntactical issues.
- Suggest improvements in the Bluetooth connection handling and data retrieval process.
- Collaborate in debugging and identifying the root cause of the connection problem.
- Share insights or best practices related to BluetoothLE development on Android.

##### Note:
This project is an opportunity for developers to contribute to an open-source initiative, learn more about BluetoothLE on Android, and collaborate with fellow developers to enhance the functionality of the application.
