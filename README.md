# Bleutoothle-powerd-android-app-for-esp32
The BluetoothLE Data Transmission App is designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of data between a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device and an Android application. The application leverages the BLE protocol to establish a connection with the device, retrieve sensor data, and display it on the Android interface.

Key Features:
1. Bluetooth Connection: The app establishes a Bluetooth connection with a specified BLE device using Android's Bluetooth Low Energy APIs.

2. Data Retrieval: It retrieves sensor data from the connected BLE device at regular intervals.

3. Real-time Display: The acquired data is dynamically displayed on the Android app's user interface in real-time.

4. User Interaction: The app provides a user-friendly interface with options such as reconnecting to the device.

Current Issue:
The project currently faces a challenge in establishing a stable Bluetooth connection and updating the UI with the sensor data. Iâ€™m actively working to resolve this issue and seeks assistance from the community to identify and rectify any potential bugs or inefficiencies.

How You Can Contribute:
- Review the provided code for any logical or syntactical issues.
